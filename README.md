# ðŸš€ UB Hacking Spring 2022 Team GKC (For Good Karma)ðŸš€

**Do you know part of your charity goes to business class tickets of a few individuals?**<br>
**How good would it be if you trust on an algorithm to ensure your charity reaches the correct people?**

## Presenting you the **GOOD KARMA COIN**

Doing charity is always a good karma, but your good intentions might not reach the deserved. Charity given to under developed or developing countries are mostly being swindled by some corrupt people in the region. The charirty reaches pockets of corrupted people instead of reaching the people who actually need it.<br>

This problem can be solved by implementing a **gkc**, a blockchain technology which ensures that your charity reaches the people who actually need it.<br>

## How it works ?<br>

In this blockchain network we have 3 types of users:
* 1. Donors
* 2. NGO or other charity organization
* 3. Vendors

Donors are the people who give away their money to charity organization in the hopes that their money is being given to the people who are in desparate need. NGO, or charity organiations are a mediators who recieve the money from the donors and buy the necessay goods needed for the people in need. Vendors are third category of users who sell their goods to the charity organizations. <br>

We use blockchain technology based on ETH network to validate if the money of the donors is being recieved by the people in need. Once a donation is reached an organization, they can buy goods from a vendor. The amount of goods bought by an organization is stored in the blockchain. Once an organization distributes the goods to the people in need, that can be validated and stored in blockchain as well. If the organization doesnt deliver more than 70% of the goods bought within a specifed time, that organization will be blacklisted in the network. If an organization is blacklisted then that organization cant recive donations or buy from vendors.<br>

By using **Kgc** we can ensure that all donations reach the people in need.
